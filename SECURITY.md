Reporting Security Issues
=========================

At Sauce Labs we take security seriously. Whether it is the code we write, the software we use or the platform services we provide, security is always extremely important. 

Please do not open an issue or pull request as this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone including malicious actors. Security issues in this project can be safely reported via the Sauce Labs Bug Bounty program. 

To report a security finding send to the following address:

    [bug-bounty@saucelabs.com](mailto:bug-bounty@saucelabs.com)

A member of the Sauce Labs Security team will be immediately notified and will begin the triage process.
